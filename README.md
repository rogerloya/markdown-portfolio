# Markdown Portfolio

In this assignment, you'll create a simple web page built with Markdown that displays information about yourself.

If you ever have any questions about Markdown syntax, feel free to reference the documentation here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

### Instructions

1. Start by forking this repository
1. In your "fork" of the repository, edit the `README.md` and replace all of the previous content with your own Markdown which should contain:
    * Roger Loya
    * At least one picture
    * https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerloya/
    * At least one bullet point list
      * I am creating a bullet point list.
      * This is the 2nd line.     
    * At least one numbered list
      1. This is my number list
      2. This is the 2nd line.  
1. Once you've added all of the previous elements, read through this markdown cheatsheet (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add one additional element not previously listed
1. Once you're done with this, adjust the settings of your repoistory to enable GitHub Pages. This should provide you a URL at which your project is hosted.
2. Update the "About" section of your repository so that your project's "website" is the GitHub Pages URL
3. Finally, turn in a link to your repository on Populi
